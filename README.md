Overview
The aim of this project is to develop an automaton that recognizes a language defined by a regular expression and to test word membership using the automaton. The project is divided into two main parts:

Part 1: Lexical Analyzer
In this phase, we will create a lexical analyzer to recognize the various tokens required for the application. This involves working with the regexp.l file.

Part 2: Axioms and Automaton Construction
In the second part, we define our axioms and their production rules in the regexp.y file. This step allows us to recognize the regular expression and build our automaton. Additionally, we define the words that need testing and generate a main file that will be compiled.

The Îµ-transition removal and determinization methods are implemented to simplify the construction of the word recognition method.

How to Use
To download and set up the project, follow these steps:

Run the following command to update the project:

go
Copy code
make update
Install the required dependencies using:

go
Copy code
make install
Building and Compilation
To compile the project, execute the following commands:

bash
Copy code
make
This will build the necessary components and generate the executable for the automaton.

Usage
After compilation, run the application using:

bash
Copy code
./your_executable_name
